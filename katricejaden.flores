(Question 1) After reading the options that you just chose, in one sentence, what did you think they did
This should give you the main git program, as well as some useful wrappers, such as a simple GUI, and a wrapper with
a terminal
1. Most terms were unfamiliar, but I understood that enabling Windows Explorer integration makes Git easier to access and use. I also chose Notepad as the default editor since it’s simple and straightforward.

(Question 2) Why would a programmer want to use the command line
2. The shell is a quick, efficient way to run code or commands directly with the OS, unlike compilers like Thonny, which take longer to load and navigate. I’ve used it before to download software, though I can’t recall which one.

(Question 3) When you type pwd again, what does the shell print out
3. After typing "cd usr/", the shell displayed "/usr" when I entered the pwd command.

Question 4) Enabling the ADD README file added a file automatically to your git repository, what file type is it (what
extension) and what is its contents
4. The ".md" file had three parts: preview, code, and blame. The preview showed the repository name and description, the code displayed it in text form, and the blame section listed the edit history.
